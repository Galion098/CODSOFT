## Project Structure

```
CODSOFT/
â””â”€â”€ Task 3/
    â”œâ”€â”€ tic_tac_toe_game.cpp   # Main C++ source code
    â””â”€â”€ README.md              # This file
```

## Features

- ðŸŽ® Play against a friend or an AI opponent
- ðŸ¤– AI uses the Minimax algorithm for optimal moves
- âœ… Detects wins, losses, and draws
- ðŸ§  Simple input interface: row, column, symbol (e.g., `1 2 O`)

## How to Compile and Run

### Compile

Use a C++ compiler like `g++`:

```bash
g++ tic_tac_toe_game.cpp -o tic_tac_toe_game
```

### Run

```bash
./tic_tac_toe_game      # On Linux/Mac
tic_tac_toe_game.exe    # On Windows
```

## Gameplay Instructions

- At launch, you'll be asked if you want to play (`y/n`)
- Choose whether to play **against another person** or **against AI**
- Players take turns entering:
  - Row index (0â€“2)
  - Column index (0â€“2)
  - Their symbol: `O` or `X`

Example input:

```
1 2 O
```

- The board updates after every valid move
- Game ends when a player wins or all cells are filled (draw)

---

## Notes

- AI always plays as `X` and goes second
- Game uses a 3Ã—3 matrix initialized with `-1` for empty cells
- No external libraries needed â€” runs in standard C++

Have fun playing or modifying the game!
